What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a hidden folder. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an in-between space.  It allows you to decide what changes to commit before doing so.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can check the status of the staging area to ensure only what makes sense is there before committing.
