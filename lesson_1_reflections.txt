How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It pointed out the lines which had differences, using + and - to show what was old vs. what was new.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I would have to do less manual versioning / saving of those documents on my own.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros - the commits are more logical and can be labeled accordingtly
Cons - there can be user error, forget to commit after changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Those files may be interrelated, with changes to one file possibly effecting the others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You can view the log to see all commits, and use diff to see the difference from one commit to the next

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always revert back to prior versions if something goes wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to start using it while developing web pages.
