When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Changes being pulled should be done only once committed / when complete

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks allow you to copy a public repository directly to your own github repository, where clones allow you to copy a repository directly to/from your machine.  Branches are strings of commits - you can have multiple branches for multiple versions of the same file.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is that you know when you begin working, you're working on the most updated copy, to reduce chance of conflict.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git or Github, you may email files back and forth, which could cause user error and also issues with conflict /  not knowing which files are most recent.
